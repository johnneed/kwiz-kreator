The stunning views they created made the peak a popular destination.  It was the site of an Inn and and hostel in the early 20th century.  To prevent to construction of an airstrip,  the US Forest Service bought the land in 1982. In 1984 the AT was routed over Max Patch making it  a favorite place for thru-hikers to pitch a tent.  \n\nAt the start of the Covid Pandemic, people flocked to Max Patch.  There are no facilities at Max Patch so sewage and trash quickly accumulated.   Photographer, Mike Wurmann documented the destruction in 2019. Photos of a small tent-city and piles of garbage shocked many in the hiking community.\n\nTo protect the native flora and fauna, the USFS banned overnight camping in 2021.
